# Current trusted baseline

## Kept changes
- monotonic viable-consensus selection
- stronger second-stage 20 px rescue search budget
- seeded second-stage 20 px fallback from 40 px loose support
- append-on-rescue for existing landmark observations
- no stale-pruning during rescue-frame append
- pose-eligible linked-landmark guard for keyframe promotion
- earlier rescued-support refresh
- minimal local bundle adjustment on promoted non-rescue keyframes
- canonical pose agreement enforced in keyframe reads
- live-pipeline threshold diagnostics in `scripts/diag_pnp_eth3d.py`

## Reverted or failed experiments
- proactive rescued-basis retracking before late support collapse
- low-cardinality multi-seed retry in second-stage seeded 40 px rescue
- other narrow support-refresh timing variants that did not improve behaviour enough to keep

## Current long-run behaviour
- BA-enabled pipeline with promotion guard and earlier rescued-support refresh now stays healthy through frame 18
- first current failure is frame 19
- long-run summary at 40 tracked frames:
  - ok / failed: 17 / 23
  - promoted frames: 2, 4, 6
  - rescue attempted / succeeded: 10 / 9
  - support refresh triggered frames: 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
  - BA attempted / succeeded: 3 / 3

## Current first failure
- frame 19
- active keyframe: 18 refreshed basis
- track inliers: 616
- raw tracked pairs: 616
- mapped by active lookup: 22
- valid landmarks / valid X_w: 22 / 22
- observation-gated pass: 22
- final PnP correspondences: 22
- pipeline result: `pnp_ransac_failed`
- rescue attempted / succeeded: true / false

## Current interpretation
- frame 19 live-pipeline diagnostics are now trustworthy
- live diagnostics use the refreshed frame-18 active basis, not the stale promoted-keyframe reference
- fixed live-bundle replay at frame 19 confirms:
  - 22 live correspondences
  - 3 px: 1 / fail
  - 5 px: 1 / fail
  - 8 px: 1 / fail
  - 12 px: 1 / fail
- live 8/12 threshold-pair replay rejects all 22 correspondences
- current bottleneck is no longer lookup starvation or stale diagnostic bundle selection
- current bottleneck is a frame-19 live PnP failure on a low-cardinality refreshed active basis

## Current open question
Why does the refreshed frame-18 active basis produce 22 coherent tracked 2D-3D correspondences at frame 19, yet fail to produce usable PnP consensus in the live pipeline?

## Best next step
Use the now-trustworthy live-bundle diagnostics to classify frame-19 more precisely:
- low-cardinality PnP search failure
- geometry incoherence
- refreshed-basis mismatch
- or mixed

# Current trusted baseline

## Kept changes
- monotonic viable-consensus selection
- stronger second-stage 20 px rescue search budget
- seeded second-stage 20 px fallback from 40 px loose support
- append-on-rescue for existing landmark observations
- no stale-pruning during rescue-frame append
- pose-eligible linked-landmark guard for keyframe promotion
- earlier rescued-support refresh
- minimal local bundle adjustment on promoted non-rescue keyframes
- canonical pose agreement enforced in keyframe reads
- live-pipeline threshold diagnostics in `scripts/diag_pnp_eth3d.py`
- live-pipeline local displacement-consistency diagnostics

## Reverted or failed experiments
- proactive rescued-basis retracking before late support collapse
- low-cardinality multi-seed retry in second-stage seeded 40 px rescue
- other narrow support-refresh timing variants that did not improve behaviour enough to keep

## Current long-run behaviour
- BA-enabled pipeline with promotion guard and earlier rescued-support refresh now stays healthy through frame 18
- first current failure is frame 19
- long-run summary at 40 tracked frames:
  - ok / failed: 17 / 23
  - promoted frames: 2, 4, 6
  - rescue attempted / succeeded: 10 / 9
  - support refresh triggered frames: 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
  - BA attempted / succeeded: 3 / 3

## Current first failure
- frame 19
- active keyframe: 18 refreshed basis
- track inliers: 616
- raw tracked pairs: 616
- mapped by active lookup: 22
- valid landmarks / valid X_w: 22 / 22
- observation-gated pass: 22
- final PnP correspondences: 22
- pipeline result: `pnp_ransac_failed`
- rescue attempted / succeeded: true / false

## Current interpretation
- frame 19 live-pipeline diagnostics are now trustworthy
- live diagnostics use the refreshed frame-18 active basis, not the stale promoted-keyframe reference
- fixed live-bundle replay at frame 19 confirms:
  - 22 live correspondences
  - 3 px: 1 / fail
  - 5 px: 1 / fail
  - 8 px: 1 / fail
  - 12 px: 1 / fail
- live 8/12 threshold-pair replay rejects all 22 correspondences
- all 22 live correspondences pass the frame-18-to-19 local displacement-consistency check
  - median residual: 2.34 px
  - p90 residual: 4.72 px
- each fixed-threshold replay produces 902 valid PnP models from 1000 trials, but no model exceeds one inlier
- current bottleneck is no longer lookup starvation or stale diagnostic bundle selection
- current bottleneck is not low-cardinality search failure or incoherent 2D tracking
- the failure is now classified as coherent 2D tracks attached to a geometrically incompatible 3D support set

## Current open question
Are the frame-19 2D-3D links wrong because the refreshed frame-18 feature-to-landmark assignments are incorrect, or because the linked landmark geometry has drifted away from the refreshed basis?

## Best next step
Replay the 22 live links against the accepted frame-18 pose and stored frame-18 observations, then separate feature-to-landmark assignment error from landmark-geometry drift.
